      <ul>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS controls the style and look of websites.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>Inline CSS: Apply to a specific HTML tag. Uses a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element.</li>
        <li>Inline is only useful for quick and permanent changes and they are less flexible than Internal Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>External Style Sheets are the most common way to style a webpage.</li>
        <li>ESS Allows developers to keep CSS rules in a separate file. Link by using < link > in the head.</li>

  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript builds the logic of websites. Basically makes it interactive and fuctional.</li>
    <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
   <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
   <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, or OOP.</li>
   <li>"for" loops use the pattern of indices to perform a task.</li>
   <li>"falsy" is 0, -0, on, " ", null, undefined, NaN, false (boolean)</li>
   <li>"truthy" is all other values, including true (boolean)</li>
   <li>JS indices always start at 0, not 1.</li>
   <li>Indices correspond to arrays. if var letters = [ "A", "B", "C"] console.log(letters[0]) would show "A"</li>
   <li>"for" loops have 3 statements. 1st statement determines the starting point</li>
   <li>2nd statement decides the condition. if number "x" is shorter than the length of the array, loop will keep running.</li>
   <li>3rd statement allows array to iterate over each item, Indices increase by 1. x++ is shortcut for x+1</li>
   <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can be built into web browsers.</li>
