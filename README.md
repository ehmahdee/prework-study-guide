# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to build this guide as an aid to help myself and others learn basic coding. This is an interactive way to keep track of your notes while practicing HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript skills. The best way to learn a language is immersion!
This was genuinely the most coding I've ever done. I learned and became comfortable with terminal and VS Code. I have a long way to go but this project really helped me get a start!
